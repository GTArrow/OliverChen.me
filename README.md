Sure! Here’s a polished **README** you can use for your **OliverChen.me** GitHub repository. I wrote it based on the fact that it’s a simple HTML/CSS/JS personal website (an online CV/portfolio) hosted in this repo. You can customize the text further if you want to add specific sections or features.
